\section{Results and Analysis}\label{Sect:results}
\par Introduction lines... Test
\par The quality of a single fit is given in Figure \ref{outputExample}. For some models, there are predictions that differ significantly, more than 100eV, from their true values. In those cases, the number of outlying crystals has been counted then excluded from the average error calculation. In this way, the average error can become independent of the model's outliers. To understand a given model's accuracy and precision visually, each prediction energy can be plotted against the actual energy for each configuration. The model referenced in Figure \ref{outputExample} can be seen again in Figure \ref{accuracyPlot}.

\end{figure}

\par The method of analysis in Figure \ref{accuracyPlot} works very well for observing one model at a time but interpreting each of the 270 unique models this way would difficult and time consuming. It would be preferable if several data sets could be interpreted at one time.
\par One solution could be a series of heatmaps showing the average error of each model with it's respective parameters. But as discussed above, the average error does not tell the whole story, the number of large errors must also be accounted. Figure \ref{aveErrorHeatmaps} shows five heatmaps, one for each size of training set. The color in each square represents the average error for a specific model. The scale for each subplot is set to be identical to make its analysis easier. A similar cluster of plots can be seen in Figure \ref{numErrorHeatmaps} showing the number of large errors for each model.

\par The true accuracy and precision of each model can only be realized when comparing its results from Figures \ref{aveErrorHeatmaps} \textit{and} \ref{numErrorHeatmaps}. One without the other does not show the full picture. For example, the lower left corner of Figure \ref{aveErrors2} appears to be surprisingly accurate but when compared to Figure \ref{numErrors2}, it can be seen that these models actually produce a considerable number of large errors. These particular models are not of interest. The models that \textit{are} of interest will be the squares from corresponding subplots in Figures \ref{aveErrorHeatmaps} and \ref{numErrorHeatmaps} that are both blue or blue-ish. It should be noted that one of the reasons the lower left corner of Figure \ref{aveErrors2} is so blue is because the large errors, as seen in Figure \ref{numErrors2}, are all excluded from the overall average error.
\par Figure \ref{numErrors2} includes a large red clump in the bottom right of the plot. This red patch then appears to move upward in each ensuing figure. \ldots \ldots \ldots
\par The most accurate and precise model was trained on 1000 sets, used 40 basis functions, and had an effective radius of 1.0. This model produced 0 large errors and had an average error of only 1.77eV. The second and third best models had very similar input parameters, changing by one step either the size of the training set or the number of basis functions.
\par Why did this model work in some places, but not in others? \ldots \ldots \ldots
\par Because this model was produced using only pair-interactions, implementation of three body interactions has the potential to greatly increase the accuracy of this model. This is, unfortunately, beyond the scope of this research.
\par The success of this simple model may be unique to this silver platinum bond and other particular crystals. But frankly, I have no clue. \ldots\ldots\ldots
