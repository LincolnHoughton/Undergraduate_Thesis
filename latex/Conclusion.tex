\chapter{Conclusion}\label{Sect:conclusion}
\par The models produced were satisfactorily successful. Each provided great insight into which parameters build useful models. Though some models are useful, none are without errors. Using the ``best" model, as mentioned in Chapter \ref{Sect:results}, new data on silver-platinum crystal configurations can be produced.


\section{Future Work}\label{Sect:futureWork}
\par Using a small set of accurate DFT data, the code written to produce the model in Chapter \ref{Sect:procedureConstruction} can be easily adapted to construct models for compounds other than Ag-Pt. Such research could be used to determine which compounds can be accurately predicted using a simple pair-interaction model. A successful model can quickly predict formation energies for a variety of crystal configurations. These formation energies could then be used to construct the materialâ€™s phase diagram and determine which phases are thermodynamically stable.
\par Because the models produced in this paper used only pair-interactions, their effectiveness is limited by their simplicity. Implementation of three-body interactions has the potential to greatly increase the accuracy of these models.
