\section{Conclusion}\label{Sect:conclusion}
\par The models produced were satisfactorily successful. Each provided great insight into which parameters build useful models. Though some models are useful, none of them are without errors. Using the ``best" model, as mentioned in Section \ref{Sect:results}, new data on silver-platinum crystal configurations can be produced. The use of this data will be discussed in section \ref{Sect:futureWork}.

\subsection{Future Work}\label{Sect:futureWork}
\par The code writen to produce the model in Section \ref{Sect:procedureConstruction} can be easily adapted to construct models with new data. Such research could be used to determine which alloy energies can be accurately predicted using a simple model. This model, as well as other potentially successful models, can be used to create theoretical phase-diagrams for these alloys without the need to chart them through experimental means \cite{solidStateBook}. This exercise has been left for the reader to complete (haha!) \ldots\ldots\ldots
