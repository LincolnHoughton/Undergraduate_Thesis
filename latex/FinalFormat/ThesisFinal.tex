\documentclass[oneside,senior]{BYUPhys}
% The BYUPhys class is for producing theses and dissertations
% in the BYU Department of Physics and Astronomy.  You can supply
% the following optional arguments in the square brackets to
% specify the thesis type:
%
%   senior  : Produces the senior thesis preliminary pages (default)
%   honors  : Produces the honors thesis preliminary pages
%   masters : Produces the masters thesis preliminary pages
%   phd     : Produces the PhD dissertation preliminary pages
%
% The default format is appropriate for printing, with blank pages
% inserted after the preliminary pages in twoside mode so you can
% send it directly to a two-sided printer. However, for ETD
% submission the blank pages need to be removed from the final output.
% The following option does this for you:
%
%   etd     : Produces a copy with no blank pages in the preliminary section.
%             Remove this option to produce a version with blank pages inserted
%             for easy double sided printing.
%
% The rest of the class options are the same as the regular book class.
% A few to remember:
%
%   oneside : Produces single sided print layout (recommended for theses less than 50 pages)
%   twoside : Produces single sided print layout (the default if you remove oneside)
%
% The BYUPhys class provides the following macros:
%
%   \makepreliminarypages : Makes the preliminary pages
%   \clearemptydoublepage : same as \cleardoublepage but doesn't put page numbers
%                           on blank intervening pages
%   \singlespace          : switch to single spaced lines
%   \doublespace          : switch to double spaced lines
%
% --------------------------- Load Packages ---------------------------------

% The graphicx package allows the inclusion of figures.  Plain LaTeX and
% pdfLaTeX handle graphics differently. The following code checks which one
% you are compiling with, and switches the graphicx package options accordingly.
\usepackage{ifpdf}
\ifpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\else
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
\fi

% The fancyhdr package allows you to easily customize the page header.
% The settings below produce a nice, well separated header.
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
  \fancyhead{}
  \fancyhead[LO]{\slshape \rightmark}
  \fancyhead[RO,LE]{\textbf{\thepage}}
  \fancyhead[RE]{\slshape \leftmark}
  \fancyfoot{}
  \pagestyle{fancy}
  \renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{\markboth{\chaptername \ \thechapter \ \ #1}{}}
  \renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{\markright{\thesection \ \ #1}}

% The caption package allows us to change the formatting of figure captions.
% The commands here change to the suggested caption format: single spaced and a bold tag
\usepackage[margin=0.3in,labelfont=bf,labelsep=none]{caption}
 \DeclareCaptionFormat{suggested}{\singlespace#1#2 #3\par\doublespace}
 \captionsetup{format=suggested}

% The cite package cleans up the way citations are handled.  For example, it
% changes the citation [1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11] into [1-3,6-11].  If your advisor
% wants superscript citations, use the overcite package instead of the cite package.
\usepackage{cite}
\usepackage{subcaption}

% The makeidx package makes your index for you.  To make an index entry,
% go to the place in the book that should be referenced and type
%  \index{key}
% An index entry labeled "key" (or whatever you type) will then
% be included and point to the correct page.
\usepackage{makeidx}
\makeindex

% The url package allows for the nice typesetting of URLs.  Since URLs are often
% long with no spaces, they mess up line wrapping.  The command \url{http://www.physics.byu.edu}
% allows LaTeX to break the url across lines at appropriate places: e.g. http://www.
% physics.byu.edu.  This is helpful if you reference web pages.
\usepackage{url}
\urlstyle{rm}

% If you have a lot of equations, you might be interested in the amstex package.
% It defines a number of environments and macros that are helpful for mathematics.
% We don't do much math in this example, so we haven't used amstex here.
\usepackage{amsmath}
% The hyperref package provides automatic linking and bookmarking for the table
% of contents, index, equation references, and figure references.  It must be
% included for the BYU Physics class to make a properly functioning electronic
% thesis.  It should be the last package loaded if possible.
%
% To include a link in your pdf use \href{URL}{Text to be displayed}.  If your
% display text is the URL, you probably should use the \url{} command discussed
% above.
%
% To add a bookmark in the pdf you can use \pdfbookmark.  You can look up its usage
% in the hyperref package documentation
\usepackage[bookmarksnumbered,pdfpagelabels=true,plainpages=false,colorlinks=true,
            linkcolor=black,citecolor=black,urlcolor=blue]{hyperref}

  \Abstract{\par The primary means of discovering novel, high-performing materials uses computer calculations and simulations to construct a material's phase diagram and determine which phases are thermodynamically stable. These calculations are computationally expensive and and produce a bottleneck in the discovery process. The approach discussed here uses a small number of these calculations for an Ag-Pt compound to train a simple pair-interaction model to predict the remainder of the needed data. Using a spread of training parameters, several models are constructed and evaluated. The accuracy of these models is visualized using a series of heatmaps. Some of the models prove useful and can be used in future work to construct an Ag-Pt phase diagram. In particular, the best model constructed maintained an average error of 1.77eV, exceeding all expectations.}

  \Acknowledgments{I would like to express my gratitude to my research advisor, Lance Nelson, for guidance and encouragement throughout my research. I am also incredibly grateful to the other BYU-I physics faculty that have taught and shaped me throughout my undergraduate degree. A special thanks to my wife for her perpetual support and love. }
